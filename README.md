# san_francisco_crimes


The project for Social Data Analysis and Visualization course at DTU.


This project investigates crime incidents reported in San Francisco. Furthermore, a more in depth analysis of crimes reported in the Tenderloin district will be visualized since this district has a high amount of incidents reported. 

To analyze the crime in San Francisco an open source dataset containing incident reports in San Francisco from 2003 to may 2018 was used [https://datasf.org/opendata/](https://datasf.org/opendata/). Since the dataset does not contain incident reports from the entire 2018 year, this year was removed from the data. The dataset contain different types of crimes. In parts of this project we will investigate specific focus groups containing: Robbery, Assault, Sex offenses, Forcible, Kidnapping, Vehicle Theft, Arson, Burglary, Larceny/Theft, Vandalism and Stolen Property.
