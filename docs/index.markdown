The Tenderloin district in San Francisco is often in the spotlight due to its high crime rates, particularly concerning drug-related offenses and violent crimes. Let's take a closer look at the data from 2003 to 2017 to understand the patterns and hotspots within this neighborhood.

To analyze the crimes an open source dataset containing incident reports in San Francisco from 2003 to may 2018 was used [https://datasf.org/opendata/](https://datasf.org/opendata/). The dataset contain different types of crimes. In parts of this project we will investigate specific focus groups containing: Robbery, Assault, Sex offenses, Forcible, Kidnapping, Vehicle Theft, Arson, Burglary, Larceny/Theft, Vandalism and Stolen Property.
