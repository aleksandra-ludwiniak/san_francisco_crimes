The Tenderloin district in San Francisco is often in the spotlight due to its high crime rates, particularly concerning drug-related offenses and violent crimes. Let's take a closer look at the data from 2003 to 2017 to understand the patterns and hotspots within this neighborhood.

The 2023 crime report on San Francisco neighborhoods (https://www.wesanfrancisco.org/data/2023-neighborhood-crime#:~:text=Examining%20property%20crimes%20in%20San,display%20higher%20property%20crime%20levels) indicates that the Tenderloin remains a significant concern regarding drug and violent crimes. There has been a slight decrease in violent crimes, from 24 to 22 incidents per 1,000 people from 2022 to 2023, but the area still experiences high rates. Despite some fluctuations, the Tenderloin continues to be a central hotspot for drug-related offenses, mirroring historical trends seen in the earlier dataand obviously the report suggests the necessity for targeted interventions to mitigate these persistent crime issues in the Tenderloin .

Linking this with the historical data highlighted in the first graph, it's clear that the challenges faced by the Tenderloin have been consistent over time. Despite efforts and changes in policy, the patterns of high crime rates, especially in violent and drug-related crimes, have not shifted significantly. This points to a need for a renewed and perhaps innovative approach to law enforcement and community engagement in the district.

The article from the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs' Association (https://sanfranciscodsa.com/applying-the-rule-of-law-to-fix-san-franciscos-tenderloin-district/) highlights a critical view of the strategies previously employed to address the Tenderloin District's issues. It advocates for a more law-focused approach, saying that policies based on social justice without substantial law enforcement consequences have not been effective. Suggested strategies include targeted law enforcement, incarceration-based rehabilitation, a zero-tolerance policy for drug activities, community engagement, and transparent spending of public funds.

In connecting this to the historical crime data and the 2023 crime report, it's apparent there is a conversation regarding the balance between social justice-oriented policies and more traditional law enforcement approaches. Despite changes over the years, the persistent high rates of drug and violent crimes in the Tenderloin suggest a need for a reassessment of strategies, possibly aligning with the tougher stance recommended by the Deputy Sheriffs' Association.

To analyze the crimes an open source dataset containing incident reports in San Francisco from 2003 to may 2018 was used [https://datasf.org/opendata/](https://datasf.org/opendata/). The dataset contain different types of crimes. In parts of this project we will investigate specific focus groups containing: Robbery, Assault, Sex offenses, Forcible, Kidnapping, Vehicle Theft, Arson, Burglary, Larceny/Theft, Vandalism and Stolen Property.
