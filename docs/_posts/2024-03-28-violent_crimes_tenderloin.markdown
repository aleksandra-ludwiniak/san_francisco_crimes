The focus groups were separated into two categories; Violent Crimes and Property crimes. Where Violent crimes include; Robbery, Assault, Sex offenses, Forcible, Kidnapping and Property crimes include; Vehicle Theft, Arson, Burglary, Larceny/Theft, Vandalism and Stolen Property. Below is a bar chart of violent and property crimes over the years in the Tenderloin district. The chart shows that during the years 2013-2015 both violent- and property crimes were at its peak. However, after these years the crimes seem to decrease. But without further investigation and the upcoming incident reports for the following years it is hard to say if this tendency is a continuing.
