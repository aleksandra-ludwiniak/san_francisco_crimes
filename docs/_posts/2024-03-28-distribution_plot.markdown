 Below you can see a heatmap of all the incidents in the Tenderloin district. The heatmap shows that crime happens all over the district and the same with the distribution of hotspots. It is hard to pinpoint where it would be safe to stay which is also something the inhabitants feel. According to the short article “SF's troubled Turk Street: City throws in towel” by C.W.Nevius [article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article SF-s-troubled-Turk-Street-City-throws-in-towel-2354707.php) the people that live there fear for their life and are even scared to go outside. Furthermore, the article describes that one area in the Tenderloin district is far worse than in any other area. This area is the first block on Turk Street which is indicated on the heatmap with a marker. The heatmap shows that that there is a hotspot in the area and according to the article violent crime at this spot is 35 times higher than in any other place in the city and 8 times higher than in any other place in the Tenderloin district.
