Now that we have seen the distribution of violent- and property crimes we will investigate where all reported incidents occurs. This is visualized with a heatmap over all the incidents in the Tenderloin district below. The heatmap shows that crime happens all over the district and the same with the distribution of hotspots. It is hard to pinpoint where it would be safe to stay which is also something the inhabitants feel. According the short article “SF's troubled Turk Street: City throws in towel” by C.W.Nevius 
[article](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article SF-s-troubled-Turk-Street-City-throws-in-towel-2354707.php)  the people that live there fear for their life and are even scared to go outside. Furthermore, the article describes that one area in the tenderloin district is far worse than in any other area. This area is the first block on Turk street which is indicated on the heatmap with a marker. The heatmap shows that that there is a hotspot in the area and according the article violent crime at this spot is 35 times higher than any other place in the city and 8 times higher than any other place in the Tenderloin district.

The second image is a geographic heat map over a street map of the Tenderloin district, with Turk Street prominently marked. This visualization uses color intensity to represent the concentration of crimes, with red indicating the highest crime density. In the map Turk Street is highlighted as a significant hotspot for criminal activity, where, is zoomed in, the color intensity indicates a high frequency of incidents.
